# Restaurant Recommendation System

This project implements a **Restaurant Recommendation System (RRS)** using collaborative and/or content-based filtering approaches in a Jupyter/Colab Notebook environment. It is designed to analyze restaurant data(Yelp Datasets) and recommend the most relevant options based on user preferences or restaurant features.

## Features

- Processes and analyzes restaurant datasets.
- Implements recommendation logic using Python.
- Visualizes results through plots.
- Offers modular code for easy adaptation to other datasets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook:
   ```
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
   jupyter notebook RRS.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset.
2. Run the preprocessing and feature extraction cells.
3. Execute the recommendation algorithm section.
4. View the recommended restaurants based on the logic implemented.

## Project Structure

- \`RRS.ipynb\`: Main notebook implementing the recommendation logic.

## Future Improvements

- Add user interface (UI) for inputting preferences.
- Integrate with a live restaurant dataset/API.
- Optimize algorithms for large-scale datasets.
